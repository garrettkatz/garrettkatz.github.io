My research spans the "full stack" of embodied artificial intelligence (AI), from low-level learning and control to high-level reasoning.  The core research question is how to achieve "vertical integration" across this stack, in a way that is interpretable and facilitates human-machine interaction.  The list below showcases several research threads across this stack, with a representative publication for each, ordered from high- to low-level.  The publication at the middle (tunable neural encoding) is the critical link that integrates across levels.

<br><br>
This research in symbolic AI is concerned with a very high-level and abstract form of reasoning: the automated discovery of new algorithms.  This particular paper focuses on algorithms for Rubik's cube that optimize two objectives: being "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God%27s_algorithm">god-like</a>" (returning near-optimal solutions), but also "folk-like" (involving a small set of rules that could reasonably be learned by a human).  The rule sets are synthesized automatically by a symbolic, bi-objective meta-search procedure.  Related work in my lab also covers other forms of abstract reasoning, including automated program synthesis and theorem proving.

This research in symbolic AI is concerned with cognitive-level robotic imitation learning.  "Cognitive-level" means that the robot does not simply imitate a human's actions.  Rather, it interprets their actions to infer a sequence of sub-goals and imitates the sub-goals.  This enables one-shot generalization to new scenarios where the same goals can be achieved but require different actions.  The system combines cause-effect reasoning to infer goals with automated planning to carry out those goals.  We validated the approach on an upper-body humanoid imitating assembly and maintenance tasks.  This approach was the foundation for many follow-up publications on robotic imitation learning, explainability, and human-robot teaming.

This research in neurosymbolic AI is concerned with the "vertical integration" of symbolic automated planning and sub-symbolic learning and control.  The system in this paper allows a human to express a robotic manipulation algorithm symbolically (i.e., as a computer program), but the algorithm is then "compiled" into a purely neural-network-based representation.  The neural representation can be optimized by reinforcement learning, achieving better performance than the original (potentially sub-optimal) human-authored procedure.  In other words, symbolic human domain knowledge can be used to "warm-start" a sub-symbolic learning process.  As opposed to most existing neurosymbolic AI, which interfaces symbolic and neural components, our approach <i>emulates</i> symbolic procedural knowledge in a purely neural implementation, like natural intelligence.

This research in deep robotic learning aims to improve balance during humanoid locomotion based on egocentric vision.  A deep neural network was trained to predict falls in advance based on visual input.  The system was compared on a large simulated dataset as well as a smaller real-world dataset collected during walking tests with the Poppy humanoid robot hardware.  Related work in my lab also covers other aspects of humanoid robotic control, including robotic grasping and trajectory optimization.

This research in numerical optimization is concerned with dynamical system analysis, and in particular, interpreting the dynamics of recurrent neural networks.  It introduces a novel and general method ("directional fiber" continuation) that can systematically enumerate multiple distinct solutions/optima to non-linear equations/objective functions.  This method has value in its own right as a semi-global optimization technique, but it also complements the other research threads in that it can help make neural and neurosymbolic systems more interpretable to human operators.
